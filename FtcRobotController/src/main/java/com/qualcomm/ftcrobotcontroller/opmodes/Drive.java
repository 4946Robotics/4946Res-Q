 * Follow an IR Beacon
 * <p>
 * How to use: <br>
 * Make sure the Modern Robotics IR beacon is off. <br>
 * Set it to 1200 at 180.  <br>
 * Make sure the side of the beacon with the LED on is facing the robot. <br>
 * Turn on the IR beacon. The robot will now follow the IR beacon. <br>
 * To stop the robot, turn the IR beacon off. <br>
